Smart Classroom System Instructions

Overview:
This Smart Classroom System integrates ESP32-CAM for facial detection, ESP8266 for data communication, and Arduino UNO for managing local hardware. It aims to enhance classroom management by detecting presence, counting faces, and monitoring temperature. The ESP8266 acts as a bridge, facilitating communication between the ESP32-CAM, Arduino UNO, and the Blynk app.

System Components:

ESP32-CAM: Handles facial detection and communicates counts to ESP8266.
ESP8266: Serves as a bridge, relaying data between ESP32-CAM, Arduino UNO, and the Blynk app.
Arduino UNO: Manages local devices based on received commands.
Blynk App: Provides a user interface for real-time data display and device control.
Setup Instructions:

Hardware Preparation:

Assemble ESP32-CAM, ESP8266, and Arduino UNO following the provided wiring diagram.
Ensure ESP8266 is properly set up to communicate with both ESP32-CAM and Arduino UNO.
Connect necessary peripherals (sensors, LEDs, buzzers) to Arduino UNO.
Software Configuration:

Load ESP32_CAM.ino onto ESP32-CAM.
Load ESP8266_Bridge.ino onto ESP8266 module.
Load Arduino_UNO_WiFi.ino onto Arduino UNO.
Blynk App Configuration:

Create a Blynk project and note the auth token.
Set up virtual pins:
V1: LED Indicator
V2: Fan Control
V3: Presence Detection
V0: Face Count
Insert auth token and WiFi credentials in all devices' code.
Operation:

ESP32-CAM monitors and sends face counts to ESP8266.
ESP8266 updates Arduino UNO and the Blynk app with face count.
Arduino UNO controls devices based on received data.
Blynk app allows remote monitoring and control.
Troubleshooting:

Power and Connections: Verify all components are correctly powered and connections are secure.
Credentials: Check if the correct auth token and WiFi credentials are used.
Serial Debugging: Utilize serial output from devices to identify errors or issues.
Blynk App Configuration: Ensure virtual pins match those defined in your code and Blynk project settings.
Network Stability: Poor WiFi signal can cause communication issues. Ensure devices are within a reliable range of your WiFi router.
Device Firmware: Ensure ESP32-CAM and ESP8266 are running the latest firmware to avoid compatibility issues.
Code Review: Double-check your code for any logical errors that might affect device behavior, especially in the sections handling data transmission.
External Resources: Consult forums and communities for similar issues and potential solutions. The Blynk Community is a great place to start.
